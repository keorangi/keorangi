<!-- Start writing your project content here -->

This is the main content area for your project. You can add text, and refer to images.
You can manage images by placing them in the `static/images/projects/` directory (or a similar path you prefer) and then referencing them using Markdown, for example: `![Alt text for image](/images/projects/your-project-slug/image-name.jpg)`.
