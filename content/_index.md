This is **Keorangi**, our workshop – a place where we explore web application ideas and dedicate ourselves to the art of digital creation. We believe in building transparently – it fosters accountability and allows us to share our journey, insights and all.

What we're focused on:

*   **Projects (Our Current Explorations):** This is where we're actively developing and refining our work. [See what we're building](/projects) – we value thoughtful design and robust functionality.
*   **Blog (Insights & Discoveries):** Our notes, technical findings, and reflections on the craft. When we learn something new or solve a challenging problem, we share it [here](/posts).

We approach our work with a spirit of inquiry and a commitment to quality. We're serious about creating well-crafted, usable digital tools. We invite you to follow our progress.
