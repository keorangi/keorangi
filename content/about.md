Keorangi. We're named after the Kea, New Zealand's alpine parrot – a bird known for its sharp intelligence, relentless curiosity, and knack for ingenious problem-solving. We find that spirit fitting for a workshop dedicated to exploring digital possibilities and crafting thoughtful solutions.

**Our Approach to Craftsmanship:**

We see software development as a true craft, demanding both skill and dedication. Our work is guided by these principles:

*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** We strive for straightforward, elegant solutions. If a design or piece of code becomes overly complex, we see it as a signal to rethink and simplify.
*   **User-Centric Design:** The experience of those who use our creations is paramount. We aim for intuitive, responsive, and genuinely useful applications.
*   **Continuous Learning & Improvement:** The digital landscape is ever-evolving, and so are we. We're committed to constantly honing our skills, exploring new technologies, and refining our processes.
*   **Building in the Open:** We believe in transparency and sharing our journey – the challenges, the breakthroughs, and the lessons learned. It’s how we grow and contribute to the wider community.

**Our Journey:**

Keorangi is a small, dedicated workshop where we explore new ideas and develop digital tools and applications with care. We're passionate about the process of building and sharing what we create.
